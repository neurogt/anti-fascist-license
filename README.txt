Anti-Fascist License
A source-available license which allows use by most entities, while forbidding use by entities that partake in discrimination
FAQ:
1. Why this license?
    In the past few years, hatred against marginalized groups has reached a very high level. Because of this, the author of this
    license felt that it was necessary to create a license that forbids the use of the licensed work to
    those who partake in discrimination, while allowing free use and modification to those who do not partake in such violations
    of human rights.
2. What can I do with this software considering that this software isn't fully open source?
    You can do anything you want with it, unless you are an entity that engages in the discrimination of members of marginalized
    groups.
3. Can I use this license in my own work?
    Sure! Please link to this repository when using it. If even one project using this license becomes prevalent, this license
    will lock out groups participating in discrimination from using the project, reducing their ability to engage in their
    marginalization.
